# Note
#### Bringing a Gun to a Trainer Fight

#### test 1
  Width and height of the dimention is [3,2].

###### Distances to wall and bouncing.
  - From your position to right and left as [2, 1] both integers are the horizontal vectors.
  - From your position to top and bottom as [1, 1] both integers are the vertical vectors.
  - If the beam travel vectors are larger than the bouncing vectors,

  - Width and height of the dimention is [3,2].
  - If delta of length between the trainer's position and yours.
  - Bouncing formula(as coord, not length):
    - The lengths to left and right wall: [1, 2]
      Length to the left wall is 1(As the x coord).
      Length to the right wall is 2 as  3(width of dimention) - 1(x coord of your position).

  - [[1,3], [1,2]] will be the same direction for trainer

```python
    delta_x = abs(trainer_position[0] - your_position[0])
    delta_y = abs(trainer_position[1] - your_position[1])
```

```python
  your_position = [1,1]
  trainer_position = [2,1]
  beam_distance = 4
```
