For instance, in the case of
```python
[
  [0, 2, 2, 2, -1],  # 0 = Start
  [9, 0, 2, 2, -1],  # 1 = Bunny 0
  [9, 3, 0, 2, -1],  # 2 = Bunny 1
  [9, 3, 2, 0, -1],  # 3 = Bunny 2
  [9, 3, 2, 2,  0],  # 4 = Bulkhead
]
```
and a time limit of 1, the five inner array rows designate the starting point, bunny 0, bunny 1, bunny 2, and the bulkhead door exit respectively. You could take the path:

| Start | End | Delta | Time | Status |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|-|0|-|1|# Bulkhead initially open|
 

```python
[
  [0, 4, -1,  2],
  [4, 2,  2,  0],
  [2, 4, -1,  1],
  [4, 3,  2, -1],  # Bulkhead closes
  [3, 4, -1,  0],  # Bulkhead reopens; you and the bunnies exit
]
```
Note
====

- The gate must be open to release bunnies at bulkhead, which means gate not open bunnies no escaped.
