So beatty sequence formed by successive multiples of a irrational number rounded down to the nearest integer.  

> The sum of the beatty sequence as  
> $\sum_{i = 1}^n \lfloor i r \rfloor$  
> $$\mathscr{B}_r^i = \lfloor{ir}\rfloor $$ 
> where r is a positive irrational number, and it's $\sqrt{2}$ in this question.  
> $$\mathcal {S}(n,r) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathcal {B}_{r}^{(i)}$$
