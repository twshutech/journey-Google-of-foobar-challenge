So beatty sequence formed by successive multiples of a irrational number rounded down to the nearest integer.  

> Let $r$ be a positive irrational number. Set $s=1/r$ , and define two sequences: $a_n=n(r+1)$ and $b_n=n(s+1)$, $n>0$ .
> $$\mathscr{B}_r^i = \lfloor{ir}\rfloor $$ 
> The sum of the beatty sequence as  
> $$\sum_{i = 1}^n \lfloor i r \rfloor$$  
> where r is a positive irrational number, and it's $\sqrt{2}$ in this question.  
> $$\mathcal {S}(n,r) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathcal {B}_{r}^{(i)}$$  
> A irrational number would be formed as  $\dfrac{a}{b}$ , number n multipies with  $\dfrac{a}{b}$  :
> $$n Ã— \dfrac{a}{b}$$
